## Project description

Easy menu is an platform developed for owners of restaurants, bars, hamburgers and establishments in general, that present their food products in the form of a menu.



### The application works with the following concept:

1.  **Product category** ----------  *like :arrow_right: Drinks*

2.  **Product subcategory** ---------- *like :arrow_right: Juices*

3.  **Item** ----------  *like :arrow_right: Orange juice*






This concept helps both when creating items through the control panel, and when reading the menu by the end user (such as a restaurant customer).

It has a simple and self-explanatory creation interface for creating and making the menu item available in a few seconds.

With this is possible to solve recurring problems of this type of establishment, such as changing prices on all physical menus or the unavailability of a product.

The end user, can access the menu through the Qr-code (if in the establishment) or through the link (from anywhere :sunglasses:);

By default, all menus are available on the platform's homepage, so users from all over the world can, for example, access the menu options of any establishment before meeting it in person.

An interesting feature, is the possibility of creating items that can be evaluated by the end user, allowing ranking, for example, special dishes that are the great differential of the establishment. :chart_with_upwards_trend: :yum:

It is also possible to define a promotional price for the item, so that the end user can search the menu for the current promotions.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:  ***It is important to remember that orders must still go through a waiter. The application does not include the functionality of ordering through the menu in order to preserve the interaction between customer and waiter, generating a more human service experience.***

Any similarities with another project is purely coincidental as it is one of many possible solutions.***
